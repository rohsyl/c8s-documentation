# Basics of CI/CD

## What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository, often multiple times a day. Each integration is automatically verified by running tests and validation checks, ensuring that new code does not introduce defects into the main branch.

CI aims to:
- Catch bugs early by automating tests on every commit.
- Reduce integration problems by merging small, incremental changes.
- Provide faster feedback to developers.

A typical CI process includes:
1. A developer pushes code to a version control system (e.g., Git).
2. An automated CI pipeline triggers, running unit tests, static analysis, and linting.
3. If all tests pass, the code is considered stable and ready for deployment.

## What is Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)?

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
Continuous Delivery ensures that every code change is automatically tested and prepared for release. However, deployments still require a manual approval step before going live.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
Continuous Deployment takes automation one step further by deploying every successful change to production without manual intervention. This means any commit that passes all automated tests is instantly released to end-users.

CD focuses on:
- Automating the release process.
- Ensuring every change is always deployable.
- Reducing the time from development to production.

## Benefits of CI/CD in Software Development

Implementing CI/CD brings several advantages:

- **Faster Development Cycles** – Automating builds, tests, and deployments reduces delays.
- **Higher Code Quality** – Automated testing ensures that issues are caught early.
- **Reduced Deployment Risks** – Smaller, frequent releases make it easier to identify and fix problems.
- **Improved Collaboration** – Developers can work in parallel without major integration conflicts.
- **Consistent and Reliable Releases** – Automated pipelines eliminate human errors in deployment.

## Step-by-Step Explanation of How CI/CD Works

A typical CI/CD pipeline follows these stages:

1. **Code Commit**
    - Developers push their code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

2. **Continuous Integration (CI) Process**
    - The CI server detects the changes and triggers automated tests.
    - Static code analysis, linting, and security scans are executed.
    - If all checks pass, the build is marked as successful.

3. **Artifact Generation**
    - If the code passes CI, an artifact (e.g., a Docker image, compiled binary) is created and stored in an artifact repository.

4. **Continuous Delivery (CD) Staging**
    - The artifact is deployed to a staging environment.
    - Integration tests, performance tests, and manual reviews may take place.
    - If everything is validated, the release is approved for production.

5. **Continuous Deployment (Optional)**
    - If using Continuous Deployment, the tested build is automatically deployed to production.
    - Monitoring tools track system health and rollback mechanisms are in place if issues arise.

By automating these steps, teams can release software quickly, reliably, and with minimal risk.
